# Architecture design

> The architecture design uses information flowing characteristics, and
> maps them into the program structure. The transformation mapping method
> is applied to exhibit distinct boundaries between incoming and outgoing
> data. The data flow diagrams allocate control input, processing and
> output along three separate modules.
